# Introduction

Welcome to **STATS 266: Introduction to R**. This handout provides an introduction about data visualization in R. By the end of this document, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To be able to use \texttt{ggplot2} to generate publication-quality graphics.
    \item To apply geometry, aesthetic, and statistics layers to a \texttt{ggplot} plot.
    \item To manipulate the aesthetics of a plot using different colors, shapes, and lines.
    \item To improve data visualization through transforming scales and paneling by group.
    \item To save a plot created with \texttt{ggplot} to disk.
\end{itemize}

For this part, valuable materials to refer to include \textcolor{blue}{https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/} and \textcolor{blue}{https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/08-plot-ggplot2.html}.

# Reading the Data

Before doing any visualization, we should read the data into our environment. At the very beginning of the course, I introduced working for a project, and \texttt{here::here()} function. That's for the file path to the document. With this function, you will not need to specify the file path again.

R can read a variety of data types, including structured and unstructured formats. Below are the common types of data that R can read along with the functions used to import them:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CSV Files}: \texttt{read.csv("file.csv")} or \texttt{readr::read\_csv("file.csv")}
    \item \textbf{Excel Files}: \texttt{readxl::read\_excel("file.xlsx")}
    \item \textbf{Text Files (TSV, Fixed Width, etc.)}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{read.table("file.txt")}
        \item \texttt{read.delim("file.txt")}
        \item \texttt{readr::read\_delim("file.txt", delim = "\textbackslash t")}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{JSON Files}: \texttt{jsonlite::fromJSON("file.json")}
    \item \textbf{XML Files}: \texttt{XML::xmlParse("file.xml")}
    \item \textbf{SPSS, SAS, and Stata Files}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{haven::read\_sav("file.sav")} (SPSS)
        \item \texttt{haven::read\_sas("file.sas7bdat")} (SAS)
        \item \texttt{haven::read\_dta("file.dta")} (Stata)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{R Binary Files}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{load("file.RData")}
        \item \texttt{readRDS("file.rds")}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Connections}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{DBI::dbReadTable(con, "table\_name")}
        \item \texttt{dplyr::tbl(con, "table\_name")}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

For efficient data handling, packages like \texttt{data.table}, \texttt{readr}, and \texttt{vroom} provide optimized functions for reading large datasets.

# Numerical Data

\texttt{ggplot2} is a package in R that can create good looking figures in R. It works like putting a layer on another layer, so we use ``+" to concatenate layers together.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()
```
If we only run a \texttt{ggplot()}, it returns to a blank figure to us, since we only set up a background, no future plots are made. For the next steps, we will use the in-built dataset ``mtcars" as examples.

## Scatter Plots

Scatter plots is one of the most commonly used plots in statistics. It visualizes the relationship between two variables. We can distinguish whether they are positively or negatively correlated based on scatter plots. It's also useful when we compare the values of two variables.
```{r}
dat <- mtcars
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = dat$mpg, y = dat$wt))
```
Based on the blank figure, we added one more layer called \texttt{geom\_point}. This returns to a scatter plot, with \texttt{aes(x = ...,y  = ...)} being the x-axis values and y-axis values. Based on this, we can do something to make the plot more readable:
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt), color = "blue", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +  # Enhancing points
  labs(
    title = "Car Mileage vs Weight",
    x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)",
    y = "Weight (1000 lbs)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)  # Using a clean theme

```
In the \texttt{labs()}, we can set the legend title, figure title, and xy axis labels. In the \texttt{geom\_point} we can set the size of the point, shape of the point, and the color of the point. There are 25 different styles of points in R:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create a dataframe with shape IDs
point_shapes <- data.frame(
  x = rep(1:6, length.out = 26),  # Adjust x positions for 26 points
  y = rep(5:1, each = 6, length.out = 26),  # Adjust y positions for 26 points
  shape = 0:25  # Shape IDs (0 to 25)
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(point_shapes, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = shape), size = 5, fill = "blue") +  # Shape varies, filled for 21-25
  scale_shape_identity() +  # Use shape IDs directly
  geom_text(aes(label = shape), nudge_y = -0.3, size = 5) +  # Label each point with its shape ID
  labs(title = "Point shapes available in R") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())

```


## Line Chart / Time Series Plot

Sometimes, if the data is a time series:
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)  # Ensure proper date handling

# Set English locale for months
# Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C") 

# Simulated time series data
set.seed(123)
time_series_data <- data.frame(
  date = seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), by = "month", length.out = 12),
  series_A = cumsum(rnorm(12, mean = 5, sd = 2)), 
  series_B = cumsum(rnorm(12, mean = 3, sd = 1.5)), 
  series_C = cumsum(rnorm(12, mean = 4, sd = 1.8))
)
time_series_data
```
The data includes three time series. So we can use a line chart to plot them together. In this format of data, we call them wide format since they are combined together with a same date at each row. However, ggplot cannot recognize this type of data, we need to transform them to a long format.

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Transform data into long format for ggplot
long_data <- time_series_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -date, names_to = "series", values_to = "value")
long_data
```
We add one more colum called ``series", it's kind of a index of which series this observation is from. Based on this:

```{r warning=FALSE}
# Plot with English x-axis labels
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = date, y = value, color = series)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) +  
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y") + 
  labs(
    title = "Multiple Time Series Plot",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Value",
    color = "Series"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```
This example adds the data directly to the ggplot() function, that means for the following geom\_ functions, by default we are using the same data, same mapping, same color settings. In the \texttt{aes()} function, x axis is the date, y axis is the value, and we set the color of the line/point is the series variable in the long format data. In the \texttt{theme()} function, we can adjust a lot of personalized preferences. Refer to: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.5.0/topics/theme. 

Time series plots can visualize the trends, like stock market and population. 

## Histogram and Density

To visualize a distribution, or how the data are distributed, we can use a histogram in ggplot2. Below, we are using normal distribution samples as an example:
```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Generate random samples from a normal distribution
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
data <- data.frame(value = rnorm(1000, mean = 50, sd = 10))

# Create histogram with a density line
ggplot(data, aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_density(color = "red", size = 1.2) +  # Add a smooth density line
  labs(
    title = "Histogram with Density Curve",
    x = "Value",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```
We first drew a blue histogram, and then set a density curve above it. 

## Correlation Matrix Plot
Correlation is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a relationship between two numeric variables. The most common measure is the Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to 1:

 - A value of **1** implies a perfect positive linear relationship
 - A value of **0** implies no linear relationship
 - A value of **-1** implies a perfect negative linear relationship

Visualizing correlation can help us better understand relationships between variables in a dataset. In this tutorial, we'll use R and the `ggplot2` package to create a correlation plot.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

### Step 1: Compute Correlation Matrix

We first calculate the correlation matrix using `cor()`.

```{r}
library(ggcorrplot)
corr_matrix <- round(cor(mtcars), 2)
corr_matrix
```

### Step 2: Visualize with ggcorrplot

We use the `ggcorrplot` package to make the visualization more intuitive. This function creates a heatmap where the color and size of the tiles represent the correlation strength.

```{r}
ggcorrplot(corr_matrix,
           method = "circle",
           type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE,
           lab_size = 3,
           colors = c("blue", "white", "yellow"),
           title = "Correlation Matrix of mtcars",
           ggtheme = theme_minimal())
```
### Step 3: Interpret the Plot

In the correlation plot:

 - **Darker blue circles** indicate strong positive correlation (e.g., weight and horsepower)
 - **Darker red circles** indicate strong negative correlation (e.g., mpg and weight)
 - **Smaller or white circles** indicate weak or no correlation

This plot helps you identify which variables are strongly related and may influence one another, which is useful in regression modeling, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis.

### Conclusion

Correlation plots provide a quick and effective way to explore relationships in your data. With `ggcorrplot` and `ggplot2`, it's easy to produce publication-quality visualizations to support your analysis.


# Categorical Data

## Grouping

We simulate two bivariate normal distributions using `MASS::mvrnorm()` and visualize them using `ggplot2`. Each group is colored differently to show separation in the 2D space.

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Parameters for Group 1
mu1 <- c(2, 3)
sigma1 <- matrix(c(1, 0.5, 0.5, 1), nrow = 2)
group1 <- mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = mu1, Sigma = sigma1)

# Parameters for Group 2
mu2 <- c(6, 7)
sigma2 <- matrix(c(1, -0.3, -0.3, 1), nrow = 2)
group2 <- mvrnorm(n = 100, mu = mu2, Sigma = sigma2)

# Combine into one data frame
df <- data.frame(
  x = c(group1[,1], group2[,1]),
  y = c(group1[,2], group2[,2]),
  group = factor(c(rep("Group 1", 100), rep("Group 2", 100)))
)

# Plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Simulated Bivariate Normals",
       x = "X", y = "Y") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

```

## Boxplot

Boxplots are used when we have multiple groups to compare. We want to compare the distribution of them, for example:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Create sample data
set.seed(123)
data <- data.frame(
  category = rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 50),
  value = c(rnorm(50, mean = 50, sd = 10),
            rnorm(50, mean = 60, sd = 12),
            rnorm(50, mean = 55, sd = 8))
)

# Boxplot with different colors for each category
ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = value, fill = category)) +  # Color by category
  geom_boxplot(color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +  # Add black borders
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("A" = "skyblue", "B" = "lightgreen", "C" = "orange")) +  # Custom colors
  labs(title = "Boxplot with Different Colors", x = "Category", y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)


```
The top edge of the box describes the third quartile of the data, the thick black line in the middle describes the median of the data, and the bottom edge of the box is the first quartile. From the plot, we can see the group B has an overall higher value than the group A and C.




## Bar plot

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_bar(fill = "steelblue")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), fill = factor(am))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
  
```


# Special Cases

## Heatmap and Contour Plot

Some spatial dataset, has a location together with a value. The location is usually given in a 2-d coordinate. In this case, we can use a heatmap or a contour plot.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)  # For multivariate normal distribution

# Generate 2D normal distribution data
set.seed(123)
mu <- c(0, 0)  # Mean vector
sigma <- matrix(c(1, 0.8, 0.8, 1), ncol = 2)  # Covariance matrix
samples <- mvrnorm(n = 1000, mu = mu, Sigma = sigma)  # Generate samples
data <- data.frame(x = samples[,1], y = samples[,2])  # Convert to dataframe

# Compute 2D density
density_data <- with(data, MASS::kde2d(x, y, n = 100))  # Estimate density
density_df <- data.frame(expand.grid(x = density_data$x, y = density_data$y), 
                         density = as.vector(density_data$z))  # Convert to dataframe

# 2D heatmap with geom_tile()
ggplot(density_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = density)) +
  geom_tile() +  # Heatmap using tiles
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +  # Color scale
  labs(title = "2D Normal Density Heatmap (Tile)",
       x = "X-axis", y = "Y-axis", fill = "Density") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)

```
```{r}
ggplot(density_df, aes(x = x, y = y, z = density)) +
  geom_contour(color = "blue", size = 0.8) +  # Contour lines
  labs(title = "2D Normal Density Contour Plot",
       x = "X-axis", y = "Y-axis") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```


## Simulated 2D Gaussian bump
```{r}

library(ggplot2)

x <- seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)
y <- seq(-3, 3, length.out = 100)
grid <- expand.grid(x = x, y = y)
grid$z <- with(grid, exp(-x^2 - y^2))

ggplot(grid, aes(x = x, y = y, z = z)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = z)) +
  geom_contour(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Contour + Heatmap", fill = "Density")

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Simulate a vector field
x <- y <- seq(-2, 2, length.out = 20)
grid <- expand.grid(x = x, y = y)
grid$u <- -grid$x
grid$v <- -grid$y

ggplot(grid, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = x + u * 0.1, yend = y + v * 0.1),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "inches")),
               color = "blue") +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Vector Field Visualization")

```


# Personalize 

## 🎨 Customizing ggplot2 Plots

`ggplot2` provides powerful tools for customizing the appearance of your plots. Personalization can help highlight important patterns, improve clarity, and make your visuals publication-ready.

### ✅ Titles, Axis Labels, and Legends

Use `labs()` to change plot title, axis names, and legend title.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Fuel Efficiency vs Weight",
       subtitle = "Grouped by Number of Cylinders",
       x = "Weight (1000 lbs)",
       y = "Miles per Gallon",
       color = "Cylinders")
```

### 🎨 Colors and Shapes

Use `scale_color_manual()` to manually define colors; use `shape =` for custom point types.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl), shape = factor(gear))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("red", "green", "blue")) +
  labs(color = "Cylinders", shape = "Gears")
```

### 🖼️ Themes and Fonts

Use built-in themes like `theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()` or customize with `theme()`.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  labs(title = "Default Theme vs Minimal Theme") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

### 🗺️ Legend Control

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")  # Other options: "bottom", "left", "none"
```

Or remove legend entirely:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

### 📐 Coordinate Control

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(2, 5), ylim = c(10, 35)) +
  labs(title = "Zoomed View")
```

### ✍️ Text and Annotation

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate("text", x = 4, y = 30, label = "High Efficiency", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Annotated Plot")
```

## 🎯 Summary

| Task                  | Function(s)                             |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Change title/label    | `labs()`, `ggtitle()`, `xlab()`          |
| Manual color palette  | `scale_color_manual()`                  |
| Font/size/position    | `theme()` with `element_text()`         |
| Theme style           | `theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()`    |
| Legend control        | `theme(legend.position = ...)`          |
| Axis limits           | `coord_cartesian()`                     |
| Add annotation        | `annotate()`, `geom_text()`             |

With these tools, your ggplot2 plots can be effectively customized for clarity, impact, and communication.
